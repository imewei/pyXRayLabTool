Interactive Notebooks
=====================

This section contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate XRayLabTool functionality
with interactive examples and visualizations.

.. note::
   These notebooks can be downloaded and run locally, or viewed as static content
   in the documentation. For the best experience, download and run them in your
   own Jupyter environment.

Available Notebooks
===================

.. note::
   Interactive notebooks will be added in future releases. Currently, the documentation
   provides comprehensive examples in the :doc:`../examples` and :doc:`../tutorials/index`
   sections.

Getting Started
===============

To prepare for running notebooks when they become available:

1. Install XRayLabTool and Jupyter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install xraylabtool jupyter matplotlib

2. Download the notebook files from the repository (when available)
3. Launch Jupyter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      jupyter notebook

4. Open the notebook files and run the cells

Online Viewing
==============

Interactive notebooks will be viewable online in future releases. For now, explore:

* :doc:`../examples` - Complete code examples with outputs
* :doc:`../tutorials/basic_usage` - Step-by-step tutorials
* :doc:`../cli_guide` - Command-line interface examples

Notebook Contents
=================

Each notebook includes:

* **Interactive code examples** you can run and modify
* **Visualizations** showing X-ray properties
* **Performance demonstrations** of calculation speed
* **Real-world examples** from materials science
* **CLI usage examples** for command-line workflows
